# Lynsie Aragon - Portfolio

Hi! I'm Lynsie, a frontend-leaning full-stack developer dedicated to creating intuitive user experiences and perfecting my bowling game. This is my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my work, share my bowling journey, and connect with others.

## New Portfolio

I created this portfolio to have a central place to share my professional work and personal interests. As someone who transitioned into tech from a completely different background, I wanted a space that shows both my technical skills and the things that make me unique - like my passion for bowling. The site serves as both a professional showcase and a way to connect with potential collaborators and employers.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies that I love working with:

- **Next.js** - My go-to React framework for building fast, SEO-friendly websites
- **React** - For creating interactive user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Because type safety makes development smoother
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling that's both beautiful and efficient
- **Cursor** - For efficient development; through professional and personal experience, I have learned to prompt Cursor to build web apps quicky and well.

## Technical Highlights

I built this portfolio to showcase several key technical skills and modern web development practices:

### Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive and works beautifully on all devices - from mobile phones to desktop screens. I used Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### Next.js App Router

I leveraged Next.js 13+ App Router for clean, intuitive routing. Each section of the portfolio (About, Experience, Bowling, Connect) has its own route, making the site easy to navigate and SEO-friendly.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js handles server-side rendering automatically, which means faster load times and better SEO. The initial page loads are server-rendered for optimal performance.

### TypeScript Integration

I used TypeScript throughout the project for better code quality and developer experience. It helps catch errors early and makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Component Architecture

The site follows a clean component-based architecture with reusable components like Job, ProjectCard, Carousel, and ContactForm. This makes the code modular and easy to maintain.

### Image Optimization

Using Next.js's Image component for automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and responsive images. This ensures fast loading times even with high-quality bowling photos.

### SEO and Performance

Built-in SEO optimizations with Next.js, including proper meta tags, semantic HTML, and fast loading times.
